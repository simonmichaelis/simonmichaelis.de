  <h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
  <p>
    I’m a 32 y/o designer and product manager, originally from Cologne, Germany.
    I studied business informationt technology (2009 - 2012) and worked for some time as a Product Manager for pirobase imperia GmbH (2011 - 2015).
    After that I started working self-employed on various projects.
  </p><p>
    I’m lucky to have worked with amazing people who have taught me a lot.
    I mostly do user interface design and product management these days.
  </p><p>
    Besides that I’m trying to learn to play some jazz.
